Hello, I'm Kalin, an 18-year-old passionate programmer from Oryahovo, Bulgaria. With 2.5 years of experience in the world of programming, I have developed a deep love for this field. Currently, I am a dedicated student at Software University (SoftUni), where I have been honing my skills in Java Web Development for the past two years.

My expertise lies in Java, and I have hands-on experience with various frameworks and technologies, including Spring (Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Security). I am also proficient in HTML/CSS and have a solid foundation in Vanilla JavaScript.

Throughout my journey, I have made projects, ranging from small-scale to large-scale, all developed using Java. These projects have provided me with invaluable experience and have allowed me to enhance my problem-solving abilities and collaborative skills.

In addition to my professional experience, I have been building web pages with HTML, CSS, and JS since I was 12 years old. I find great satisfaction in creating beautiful, functional web experiences, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques.

I am always eager to learn and grow in the world of programming, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects and making a meaningful impact.
